\description{
Resampling with SMOTE.
}
\details{
SMOTE (Chawla et al., 2002) is an oversampling method which creates links
between positive samples and nearest neighbors and generates synthetic
samples along that link.

It is well known that SMOTE is sensitive to noisy data. It may create more
noise.
